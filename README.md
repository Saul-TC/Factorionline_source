# Factorionline (is not a server)
Keep your Factorio multiplayer games in sync—without a dedicated server!

Factorionline is a simple tool that automatically pushes your Factorio game saves to a GitHub repository and pulls the latest version before each session. This makes it easy to play with friends asynchronously, allowing each player to contribute to the same game without needing to be online at the same time.

🔧 ### Features
📂 Sync save files to/from GitHub

🤝 Share your game with friends effortlessly

🕒 Play asynchronously—no server required

🚀 ### How It Works
Each player installs the tool—everything else is automatic.

The tool pulls the latest save file from GitHub.

After playing, it commits and pushes the updated save.

Perfect for casual co-op games or long-running factory builds with friends!

⚠️ ### Warnings
The tool requires an SSH key to be configured on your system.

It does not support simultaneous play by multiple users.

You must configure the path to your local Factorio save files manually.
